JOHN EGERTON: <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>What I'd like to do, I'd like to, I know, </b></span> I know your historical personal background about your parents meeting at Walden <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>and</b></span> you know we've talked about that <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>at Roger Williams</b></span></span>, we've talked about that before and about how you got to Nashville from Oklahoma and all that, but I want to kind of pick up about the time when you were an undergraduate at Fisk in the 30s and ask you first a couple of things. One, do you recall any meetings, interracial meetings that took place on the Vanderbilt campus during those years?

JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN: No.

JOHN EGERTON: Never happened?

JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN: No, never happened so far as I know.

JOHN EGERTON: At Fisk, yes, but at Vanderbilt, no.

JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN: That's right.

JOHN EGERTON: The people from Vanderbilt would come over there, but not the other way around?

JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN: That's right, and I don't know whether you remember the famous meeting, maybe then I would have to back up and say I know of one, where a number of people, distinguished sociologists, probably Robert Park <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>and</b></span></span> people like that, I'm not certain who they were, they had a meeting out at Vanderbilt and invited  E. Franklin Frazier <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>out there</b></span>. It might even have been a luncheon, and I think Chancellor Kirkland learned about <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>it</b></span>.

JOHN EGERTON: This would have been in that period when you were an undergraduate?

JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN: Yes. It would have been because, you see, Frazier left at the end of my junior year. Went to <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>Howard</b></span></span> in 1934. Other incidents that I remember in <span style="background-color: #fbb;"><b>international</b></span></span> and at Vanderbilt was when, in my senior year, the spring of my senior year, I was an applicant for admission to Harvard to go to graduate school. This is before the GRE's, you see. So they wanted me to take a scholastic Aptitude Test, and, of course, it was scheduled, like the GRE's, at a certain time and place. And it was at Vanderbilt, and it was in a certain room on Vanderbilt campus, and I went there.
